A common problem is how to estimate the partition size reasonably when users install Linux operating system. With the logical volume management mechanism of Linux, it is easy to adjust the partition capacity dynamically without stopping the original service, so as to meet the needs of the actual situation. LVM is the abbreviation of Logical Volume Manager. It is located in the middle of disk partition and file system. The purpose of adding a logical layer is to shield the underlying disk partition from the file system. The user understands a logical and abstract volume and builds a file system again on the basis of the volume. Its greatest function is to dynamically manage the disk, that is, dynamically adjust the upper logical volume, without losing data. When we add a new hard disk, we do not change the existing logical volume, which greatly increases the flexibility of disk management.
